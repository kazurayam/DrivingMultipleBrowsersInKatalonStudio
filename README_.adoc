= Driving Multiple Browsers in Katalon Studio

== Problem to solve

== Solution


== Envrionment setup

=== Installing docker command

I installed `docker` command into my Mac Book Air

```
$ brew install docker
...
```

I checked if the `docker` command is running.

```
$ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61
:~
$ 
```

Windows users can use "Docker Desktop on Windnows" of course,

* https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/


=== Starting up HTTP server at http://127.0.0.1/

I made a temporary directory named `flaskr` where I launch a web app.
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir flaskr
```

I started a web app using a docker image.
```
$ cd ~/flaskr
$ docker run -it -p 80:8080 --rm kazurayam/flaskr-kazurayam:1.0.3
Serving on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Or, you can use the following shell script in the root directory of this project.

* link:./startup_flaskr.sh[startup_flaskr.sh]
[source,shell]
----
include::./startup_flaskr.sh[]
----


Now I want to open a browser and visit the following URL.

* http://127.0.0.1:80/

image:docs/images/flaskr_just_started.png[]

=== What is this web app?

This is the sample web app of https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/["Flask Tutorial"]. It is _a basic blog application called Flaskr. Users will be able to register, log in, create posts, and edit or delete their own posts._ I justed typed in the sample codes as published.

I made a docker image which is publicly available at Docker Hub :

* https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kazurayam/flaskr-kazurayam

== Web UI Test Scenario

1. I will use *Flaskr* at `http://127.0.0.1` as a partner for me to develop a set of test scripts in Katalon Studio. 

2. I will open 2 Chrome browsers. On each, I will visit the Flaskr site and interact with it. I will keep 2 browsers open and operate on them simultaneously.

3. On one browser, I will register a user *Alice* and make some posts.

4. On another browser, I will register another user *Bob* and make some posts.

5. Alice should be able to read the posts made by Bob. Bob should be able to read the posts made by Alice. My web ui test in Katalon Studio will check this conversation.
