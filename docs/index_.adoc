Here I am going to explain what I have done to test a Blog app using 2 browser windows simultaneously. I used Katalon Studio. I wrote my test scripts in 2 ways; one in the typical Katalon Studio style, another using Page Object Model

This project is meant to be [underline]#a set of sample codes for myself to develop a large scale test suite in future#.

== Movie for demonstration

For those who don't have time, please have a look at the following movie. This shows how my Web UI test works.

== Problem to solve

I want to answer to https://forum.katalon.com/t/using-webui-openbrowser-to-open-multiple-browsers-to-perform-actions-on-those-browser/8206[a question] raised in the Katalon Forum with a runnable sample code set.

Please imagine. I can create 2 users to be authenticated by the web app. I would open 2 windows of Chrome browsers simultaneously. From each Chrome, I would visit the http://127.0.0.1/ as 2 users each. When a user "Alice" made a post, then another user "Bob" should be able to see the post by Alice in an instant. When Bob made a new post, then soon Alice should be able to see the Bob's post.

This test scenario --- testing a web app with 2 browsers simultaneously --- can be extended to business use cases. Suppose that I have an EC site which has dual user interface: Customer UI and Administrator UI. When a user submit an order to purchase some products, then an administrator should be able to see the order in the list of outstanding orders. I want to test both of the Customer UI and the Administrator UI at the same time. My Web UI test should simulate submitting an order in the Customer UI; then my test my test should verify if the order is appearing in the Administrator UI. I want my test to simulate such dual-participants' interaction.

*But how can I open 2 browsers simultaneously in Katalon Studio?*

There is a basic problem in Katalon Studio. Using `WebUI.openBrowser()` keyword, you can not open 2 browsers.

I made a Test Case link:https://github.com/kazurayam/FlaskrTestInKatalonStudio/blob/master/Scripts/analysis/1_WebUI_openBrowser_twice/Script1640780797502.groovy[Test Cases/analysis/WebUI_openBrowser_twice] in Katalon Studio to demonstrate this problem.

[source, groovy]
----
include::../Scripts/analysis/1_WebUI_openBrowser_twice/Script1640780797502.groovy[]
----

This simple script calls `WebUI.openBrowser()` keyword twice. Do we see 2 windows of browsers opened? --- No. The 1st window opens but is immediately closed by Katalon Studio before the 2nd window opens. 

image:./images/analysis/1st_browser_is_closed_before_2nd.png[1st_browser_is_closed]

This way the `WebUI.openBrowser()` is designed. You can not open 2 browses using this keyword.

== Solution

=== opening browsers by WebDriver API

Behind the `WebUI.openBrowser()` and other `WebUI.xxx` keywords , an instance of https://www.browserstack.com/guide/selenium-webdriver-tutorial[Selenium WebDriver] is working. If I write a script that makes an instances of `WebDriver` class by calling `org.openwa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver` directly, then I can open a Chrome browser. My script can create 2 instances of `WebDriver` and keep them running. Then I will have 2 windows of Chrome browser. My test script can talk to them via the WebDriver API such as `driver.navigate().to("http://127.0.0.1/")`.

While opening browsers with WebDriver API, still I want to use `WebUI.xxx` keywords. There is a pitfall. Katalon's `WebUI.xxx` keyword do not work with a browser (a `WebDriver` instance) that my script instantiated. Let me show you an experiment.

link:https://github.com/kazurayam/FlaskrTestInKatalonStudio/blob/master/Scripts/analysis/2_WebUI_keywords_do_not_know/Script1640781667491.groovy[Test Cases/analysis/2_WebUI_keywords_do_not_know]

[source,groovy]
----
include::../Scripts/analysis/2_WebUI_keywords_do_not_know/Script1640781667491.groovy[lines=6..16]
----

This script opens a Chrome browser window by calling `new ChromeDriver()`. But the script does not inform Katalon Studio of the WebDriver instance. WebUI keywords are not aware of the browser. Therefore calling `WebUI.getWindowTitle()` keyword fails.

image:./images/analysis/2_unable_to_get_title.png[]

=== informing Katalon Studio of browsers opened by WebDriver API

How to fix this error? --- call `DriverFactory.changeWebDriver(WebDriver browser)`.

link:https://github.com/kazurayam/FlaskrTestInKatalonStudio/blob/master/Scripts/analysis/3_how_to_inform_WebUI_keywords/Script1640781643037.groovy[TestCases/analysis/3_how_to_inform_WeebUUI_keywords]

[source, groovy]
----
include::../Scripts/analysis/3_how_to_inform_WebUI_keywords/Script1640781643037.groovy[]
----

This code passes.

image:./images/analysis/3_capable_to_get_title.png[capable]

Now `WebUI.xxx` keywords can interact with the browser which was created by my script using `new ChromeDriver()` API.

=== Magic spells for opening 2 browsers

In short, the following is the magic spells you need to know.

1. In Katalon Studio, test script can open 2 browsers by calling `new ChromeDriver()` API twice.

2. a test script can call `DriverFactory.changeWebDriver(WebDriver)` API so that `WebUI.xxx` keywords can interact with the browser which was created by the script. 

== Application Under Test at a glance

I will use a Web Application named "Flaskr" as a test bed. Flaskr is the sample code presented by 
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial/["Flask Tutorial"]. It is 

____
a basic blog application called Flaskr. Users will be able to register, log in, create posts, and edit or delete their own posts.
____

I just typed the sample codes as published without any changes, and made a docker image. Later I will describe how to run it on your local PC. Let me go through the screenshots of Flarkr to see what it is.

I open Chrome browser to visit the URL of the Application Under Test: 

* http://127.0.0.1/

I find the index page as follows, which has no blog posts submitted yet.

image:./images/test_flaskr/1_start_from_here.png[1]

At first, I need to register a User for me before creating posts. I click the `Register` link. Then a form is presented where I am requested to type a credential (username and password pair).

image:./images/test_flaskr/2_going_to_register_a_username.png[2]

I click the `Register` button. Then the user will be registered. I am transferred to the Login page.

image:./images/test_flaskr/3_a_username_has_been_registered.png[3]

I re-type the credential (username and password) that I used to create my User.

image:./images/test_flaskr/4_about_to_login.png[4]

I click the `Log In` button. Then I am transferred to the Index page. Please note that the username is displayed in the header. This implies that now I am logged into this blog application.

image:./images/test_flaskr/5_the_user_have_logged_in.png[5]

Now I am going to create a new post. I click the `New` link. Then a empty form is displayed.

image:./images/test_flaskr/6_opened_page_to_create_a_new_post.png[6]

I type texts into the `title` and `body` field.

image:./images/test_flaskr/7_has_typed_texts_into_a_post.png[7]

I click the `Save` button. Then I am transferred to the index page. Please find a post has been saved into the Blob system and is now displayed in the list of posts.

image:./images/test_flaskr/8_the_post_is_found_in_the_list.png[8]

== Solution described

=== Installing docker command

You need the `docker` command on your own PC. I installed `docker` command into my Mac Book Air using Homebrew.

```
$ brew install docker
```

I checked if the `docker` command is operational.

```
$ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.2, build 2291f61
:~
$ 
```

Windows users can use "Docker Desktop on Windows",

* https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/


=== Starting up Flaskr server at http://127.0.0.1/

You need a temporary directory with any name.
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir flaskr
```

In the temp directory, you want to execute the `docker run` command:

```
$ cd ~/flaskr
$ docker run -it -p 80:8080 --rm kazurayam/flaskr-kazurayam:1.0.3
Serving on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Or, you can use the following shell script in the root directory of this project.

* link:https://github.com/kazurayam/FlaskrTestInKatalonStudio/blob/master/startup_flaskr.sh[startup_flaskr.sh]
[source,shell]
----
include::../startup_flaskr.sh[]
----


Now I can open a browser and visit the following URL.

* http://127.0.0.1:80/

You can stop the HTTP server by CTRL+C.

Flaskr has an internal database where user credentials and posts are persisted. When Flaskr is stopped and re-started, it clears the database to the initial state. 

=== Flaskr docker image

I made a docker image which is publicly available at Docker Hub :

* https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kazurayam/flaskr-kazurayam

See https://github.com/kazurayam/MyPythonProjectTemplate[MyPythonProjectTemplate] (japanese only) how I created this docker image.

This script opens a Chrome browser using Katalon Studio's built-in keyword `WebUI.openBrowser`. It navigates to a URL, verifies if the loaded page is the one expected. This is a typical/simplest test script in Katalon Studio.

[source, groovy]

This script does a bit more than `TC1_openn_close`. It interacts with the "Flaskr" web app.

1. It opens a Chrome browser usig Katalon keyword `WebUI.openBrowser()` and navigate to the Flarkr URL.
2. It registers a new user "Alice".
3. It logs in the Flaskr app using the user "Alice".

This script is coded in the typical style of Katalon Studio's test case.

This script demonstrates how to perform a Web UI test using 2 browsers in Katalon Studio.

1. This script opens 2 windows of Chrome browser.
2. It interacts with Flaskr app as 2 users "Alice" and "Bob" through each 2 windows.
3. Alice logs in Flaskr, makes a post. The post shows a lyrics of a famous song.
4. Bob logs in Flaskr, makes a post. The post shows a lyrics of another famous song.
5. _Alice checks if she finds a post made by Bob in the list of posts in Flaskr._
6. _Bob checks if he finds a post mode by Alice._

This script introduces Groovy functions (e.g, `def login()`) in order to reduce code duplications.

This script does exactly the same as link:https://github.com/kazurayam/FlaskrTestInKatalonStudio/blob/master/Scripts/flaskr/TC3_Alice_and_Bob_interact/Script1640905753452.groovy[flaskr/TC3_Alice_and_Bob_interact]. But the code looks quite different. It employs the design pattern https://www.guru99.com/page-object-model-pom-page-factory-in-selenium-ultimate-guide.html[Page Object model].
